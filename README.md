This is a prototype of SAR workflow code called *aludra* that aims to replace the overly-complex [ga_sar_workflow](https://github.com/geoscienceAustralia/ga_sar_workflow) with something much simpler. The main GAMMA workflow is contained in the file `run_gamma_workflow` and clocks in at 21 lines of code.

> [!important]  
> Since this is a prototype, this code is not to be shared outside GA's Geodescy group until it has been rewritten to be a more complete solution in the next stage of the project.
